    <h1>About Us</h1>
    <p>We are two individuals driven by the vision of a better India, where education and opportunities shape a brighter future for all. <strong>The Utopian India</strong> is our platform to bring change, starting with educational reforms that truly benefit the next generation.</p>

    <p>Our journey began with a simple goal: to give students a voice in shaping the education system they are a part of. Together, we aim to highlight the issues, spark conversations, and work toward meaningful reforms that empower students to think critically, innovate, and grow into future-ready citizens.</p>

    <p>Through <strong>The Utopian India</strong>, we are gathering insights from students, educators, and citizens to drive impactful changes. Our focus is not just on education but on fostering a society where creativity, mental well-being, and inclusive opportunities are at the core.</p>

    <p>Join us on this journey of change, and help shape the India of tomorrow.</p>
